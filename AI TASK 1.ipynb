    "Project Summary:\n",
    "The PollutionBot Project aims to create an interactive chatbot that raises awareness and facilitates discussions about environmental pollution in Delhi. The bot engages users by asking pollution-related questions, responding to inputs about air quality, health impacts, government efforts, and solutions, and encouraging meaningful conversations about mitigating pollution. It combines regex-based intent recognition and a conversational approach to educate users and promote sustainability."
