## 1. Rule-Based Chatbot to Discuss the Environmental Pollution Issues in Delhi🤖  

The Rule-Based Chatbot is a simple conversational agent that responds to user inputs using predefined rules. This project introduces the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and conversation flow.  

### Features  
- Identifies user queries using if-else statements or pattern matching techniques.  
- Provides predefined responses to common queries.  
- Easy-to-understand and extendable rules.

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe with AI Integration🎮  

The Tic-Tac-Toe AI is an unbeatable AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This project demonstrates concepts from Game Theory and basic search algorithms.  

### Features  
- Implements the Minimax algorithm to ensure the AI never loses.  
- Includes an optional Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization for faster decision-making.  
- Supports a human-vs-AI game mode.

## 3. Recent Hindi Movies Recommendation System📚  

The Recommendation System suggests items to users based on their preferences using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.  

### Features  
- Recommends movies, books, or products based on user input.  
- Supports techniques like cosine similarity and nearest neighbors.  
- Demonstrates the fundamentals of recommendation algorithms.  


---


### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+ 
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `random`
